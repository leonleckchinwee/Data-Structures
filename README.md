# Data Structures & Algorithm
This is a CS student's attempt to implement data structures and algorithm from scratch.<br>
The aim is for this project to serve as a refresher and practice to improve my programming skills.<br>
For each data structure, I will try my best to implement as many helper functions and methods as possible,
while also taking care of optimizations and edge cases.

## Current State
I am currently focusing on implementing data structures in C#.<br>
I have also included basic unit tests.
